### Challenge  
**Update Possible / OTA Updates for ECUs**

### Core Idea  
- Build a cloud-to-vehicle OTA update system using **Eclipse Symphony**, **uProtocol**, and **Ankaios**.  
- Enable secure, reliable updates with rollback capability and multi-site rollout support.  
- Sketch/diagram: You can create a simple **Mermaid chart** showing cloud → Symphony → Ankaios agents → vehicle ECUs.

## 2. How Do You Work

### Development Process  
1. **Plan**: Define update workflow, security, and compliance requirements.  
2. **Design**: Architect the system (cloud-to-vehicle) using Symphony, uProtocol, and Ankaios.  
3. **Implement**: Develop orchestrator, update policies, and vehicle communication modules.  
4. **Test**: Simulate updates, rollback, and multi-site rollouts in a controlled environment.  
5. **Deploy**: Deliver updates securely, verify integrity, and monitor progress.

### Planning & Tracking  
- Use **GitHub** for task management.  
- Prioritize tasks and track progress using **burndown charts**.

### Quality Assurance  
- Manual testing to ensure features meet expected quality standards.  
- Document all processes and code for transparency.

### Communication  
- Daily meetings to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps.  

### Decision Making
